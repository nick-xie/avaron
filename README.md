# Avaron
Because playing heads down at the start of every Avalon game starts to get tedious.
##Usage
Pretty intuitive. Choose to either create a new game and you'll be placed into a new game room or join an already existing game room through an access code. Once everyone's in the game, press start and each player will receive their role individually on their device.
##Disclaimer
[The Resistance: Avalon](http://www.indieboardsandcards.com/resistance.php) is a board game designed by Don Eskridge and published by [Indie Boards & Cards](http://www.indieboardsandcards.com/).
